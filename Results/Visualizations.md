## ROC Curve
<img src="https://github.com/rosaaestrada/Loan-Default-Prediction/blob/main/Results/Images/ROC%20curve.png?raw=true" alt="" width="500" height="500">

- Shows overall model performance and compares logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree
- It captures the predictive power of your models and is oftern the go-to metric for classification tasks

- Provides insight into the classification accuracy of each model, showing how many instances are corectly or incorrectly classified
- complements the ROC curve by showing actual vs. predicted performance in detail. 



## Feature Importance: Random Forest and Decision Tree

<img src="" alt="" width="500" height="500">

- highlights the most important features for each tree-based model, showing which features have the most predictive power.
- Helps explain why the models perfrom the way they do



## Correlation Matrix Heatmap of selected features

- shows relationships between the key features you've selected for modeling
- provides an understanding of the interactions between the most relevant variables

## Correaltion Matrix Heatmap Explanation for Natural Disasters

- Explains the correlation (or lack thereof) between natural disasters and loan status
- Natural Disasters do not significantly impact loan status.
