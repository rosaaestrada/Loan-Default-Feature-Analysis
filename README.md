# Loan Default
## Predicting What Features Influence Loan Default

### Data

### Project Overview and Objectives
**Research Question:** 

What borrower details, financial attributes, and potential interactions predict loan default for loans issued between 2012 and 2019 using Advanced Machine Learning techniques?

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** 

Suggests that there is a significant between at least one of the borrower details, financial attributes, or potential interactions and loan defaults for loans between 2012 and 2019 using Advanced Machine Learning techniques.

**Null Hypothesis (H0):** 

Suggests no significant relationship between borrower details, financial attributes, or potential interactions and loan defaults for loans issued between 2012 and 2019 using Advanced Machine Learning techniques.

**Methodology**

This project employs a structured methodology consisting of several key stages: data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and feature selection. Following those steps, predictive modeling is conducted utilizing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms. Finally, the project culminates with a comprehensive feature importance analysis, using techniques such as Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve evaluation.
