## Purpose
*This project was completed as my thesis for my Masters degree at National University*

In this project I predicted which factors influence loan default using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms. 


## 1Ô∏è‚É£ First Research Question

üî∏ What borrower details, financial attributes, and potential interactions predict loan default for loans issued between 2012 and 2019 using Advanced Machine Learning techniques?

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Second Research Question

üî∏ Could the occurence of natural disasters, as witness in the United States from 2012 to 2019, be used as a predictor for loans defaults?


## Methodology

This project employs a structured methodology consisting of several key stages: data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and feature selection. Following those steps, predictive modeling is conducted utilizing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms. Finally, the project culminates with a comprehensive feature importance analysis, using techniques such as Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve evaluation.
