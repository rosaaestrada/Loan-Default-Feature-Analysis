### Data
**Lending Club Loan Data:** Located on [Kaggle.com - Lending Club Loan Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarshsng/lending-club-loan-data-csv)
- Loan data for all loans issued through 2007-2015
- **About dataset:** Lending Club is a peer-to-peer Lending company based in the US. They match people looking to invest money with people looking to borrow money. When investors invest their money through Lending Club, this money is passed onto borrowers, and when borrowers pay their loans back, the capital plus the interest passes on back to the investors.

### Project Overview and Objectives
**Research Question:** What borrower details, financial attributes, and potential interactions predict loan default for loans issued between 2012 and 2019 using Advanced Machine Learning techniques?

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Suggests that there is a significant between at least one of the borrower details, financial attributes, or potential interactions and loan defaults for loans between 2012 and 2019 using Advanced Machine Learning techniques.

**Null Hypothesis (H0):** Suggests no significant relationship between borrower details, financial attributes, or potential interactions and loan defaults for loans issued between 2012 and 2019 using Advanced Machine Learning techniques.

**Methodology**

This project employs a structured methodology consisting of several key stages: data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and feature selection. Following those steps, predictive modeling is conducted utilizing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms. Finally, the project culminates with a comprehensive feature importance analysis, using techniques such as Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve evaluation.

**Second Research Question to this Project:** Analyzing if natural disasters can be used as a predictor for Loan Default. Located on Kaggle "Natural Disasters as Predictor for Loan Default"
